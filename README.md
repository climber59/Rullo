# Rullo
My attempt to recreate [Rullo](http://crescentyr.com/rullo/) by [Crescentyr](http://crescentyr.com/)


The goal of the game is to reach the target sums in each row and column. Left Click a tile to turn it on or off. Ricght Click a tile to lock or unlock its current state. When a row or column reaches the target sum, the target will gain a yellow outline. Clicking the target that's been fulfilled will lock and unlock the entire row or column.

'New' will generate a new puzzle for you. 'Reset' will reset the current puzzle.

The first set of text boxes allow you to change the number of rows and columns in the puzzle. Generally, the puzzle becomes more difficult the larger it is.

The second set of text boxes allow you to set the minimum and maximum numbers that will appear in the puzzle. Generally, the larger the range, the easier the puzzle is. I recommend trying 2 to 4 for a challenging puzzle and -9 to 9 an interesting twist on the default 1 to 9.

By default, the sums will be shown around all sides of the grid on blue tiles. However, you can use the dropdown box to change what the right and bottom targets display. In the screenshot below, I set them to display the difference between the current and target sums, as I find it to be the most helpful. The targets also turn orange to help remind you that they are no longer the target sums.
